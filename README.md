# Lagos-state-crime-Prediction

As the commercial hub of Nigeria and West Africa, Lagos State has witnessed significant and rapid urban growth. Due to the high concentration of banks, industries, companies, and other commercial enterprises, it has become a natural target for criminals. Consequently, the crime rate in Lagos is much higher than in other regions of the country.
